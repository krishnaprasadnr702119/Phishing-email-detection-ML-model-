There are many new AI-powered learning experiences you can try on Educative today. But the one I‚Äôm most excited about right now is our AI Mock Interviewer.

It's the first of its kind in the industry. And now it's loaded up with even more interview loops (including Coding Interviews, System Design, API Design, and Object Oriented Design).

So today I want to tell you a bit about the inspiration for AI Mock Interviews ‚Äî and in my opinion what it makes it such a unique and powerful resource.

üíº AI Mock Interviews

There‚Äôs an old piece of advice in developer circles: Interview at lots of different companies before you go interview with the company you really want to work with. While this may seem like a nice way to lower the stakes and get real world practice, it's highly inefficient and impractical.

Mock interviews, meanwhile, are a great way to get confidence and constructive feedback ‚Äî but unfortunately, 99% of candidates don‚Äôt have the resources to get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù mock interview before their interview. It can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars per interview to purchase one.

Plus, most people also don‚Äôt have friends who work at FAANG who will offer you their time to mock interview them!

Unlike traditional mock interviews, AI Mock Interviews give you multiple attempts to hone your skills ‚Äî without shelling out a ton of cash every time.

You can also prepare from the comfort of your home, without the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed or unprepared, or running the risk of burning any bridges.

The best part is that there are over 50 individual interview questions you can practice. For Coding Interviews, you can dive into dozens of the most popular data structures and coding interview patterns. For System Design, API Design, and OOD, you can get practice with dozens more real-world interview questions.

Above all, AI Mock Interviews are the perfect complement to our most popular interview prep courses here on Educative. In fact, with this addition, Educative is easily the most comprehensive tech interview prep platform in the industry.

If you have interviews coming up, I truly believe you don't need to look any further than Educative.

There are many new AI-powered learning experiences you can try on Educative today. But the one I‚Äôm most excited about right now is our AI Mock Interviewer.

It's the first of its kind in the industry. And now it's loaded up with even more interview loops (including Coding Interviews, System Design, API Design, and Object Oriented Design).

So today I want to tell you a bit about the inspiration for AI Mock Interviews ‚Äî and in my opinion what it makes it such a unique and powerful resource.

üíº AI Mock Interviews

There‚Äôs an old piece of advice in developer circles: Interview at lots of different companies before you go interview with the company you really want to work with. While this may seem like a nice way to lower the stakes and get real world practice, it's highly inefficient and impractical.

Mock interviews, meanwhile, are a great way to get confidence and constructive feedback ‚Äî but unfortunately, 99% of candidates don‚Äôt have the resources to get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù mock interview before their interview. It can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars per interview to purchase one.

Plus, most people also don‚Äôt have friends who work at FAANG who will offer you their time to mock interview them!

Unlike traditional mock interviews, AI Mock Interviews give you multiple attempts to hone your skills ‚Äî without shelling out a ton of cash every time.

You can also prepare from the comfort of your home, without the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed or unprepared, or running the risk of burning any bridges.

The best part is that there are over 50 individual interview questions you can practice. For Coding Interviews, you can dive into dozens of the most popular data structures and coding interview patterns. For System Design, API Design, and OOD, you can get practice with dozens more real-world interview questions.

Above all, AI Mock Interviews are the perfect complement to our most popular interview prep courses here on Educative. In fact, with this addition, Educative is easily the most comprehensive tech interview prep platform in the industry.

If you have interviews coming up, I truly believe you don't need to look any further than Educative.

There are many new AI-powered learning experiences you can try on Educative today. But the one I‚Äôm most excited about right now is our AI Mock Interviewer.

üíº AI Mock Interviews

There‚Äôs an old piece of advice in developer circles: Interview at lots of different companies before you go interview with the company you really want to work with. While this may seem like a nice way to lower the stakes and get real world practice, it's highly inefficient and impractical.

Mock interviews, meanwhile, are a great way to get confidence and constructive feedback ‚Äî but unfortunately, 99% of candidates don‚Äôt have the resources to get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù mock interview before their interview. It can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars per interview to purchase one.

You can also prepare from the comfort of your home, without the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed or unprepared, or running the risk of burning any bridges.

The best part is that there are over 50 individual interview questions you can practice.

For System Design, API Design, and OOD, you can get practice with dozens more real-world interview questions.

Above all, AI Mock Interviews are the perfect complement to our most popular interview prep courses here on Educative. In fact, with this addition, Educative is easily the most comprehensive tech interview prep platform in the industry.

Unlike traditional mock interviews, AI Mock Interviews give you multiple attempts to hone your skills ‚Äî without shelling out a ton of cash every time.

You can also prepare from the comfort of your home, without the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed or unprepared, or running the risk of burning any bridges.

The best part is that there are over 50 individual interview questions you can practice. For Coding Interviews, you can dive into dozens of the most popular data structures and coding interview patterns. For System Design, API Design, and OOD, you can get practice with dozens more real-world interview questions.

Above all, AI Mock Interviews are the perfect complement to our most popular interview prep courses here on Educative. In fact, with this addition, Educative is easily the most comprehensive tech interview prep platform in the industry.

If you have interviews coming up, I truly believe you don't need to look any further than Educative.

There are many new AI-powered learning experiences you can try on Educative today. But the one I‚Äôm most excited about right now is our AI Mock Interviewer.

There are many new AI-powered learning experiences you can try on Educative today. But the one I‚Äôm most excited about right now is our AI Mock Interviewer.

It's the first of its kind in the industry. And now it's loaded up with even more interview loops (including Coding Interviews, System Design, API Design, and Object Oriented Design).

So today I want to tell you a bit about the inspiration for AI Mock Interviews ‚Äî and in my opinion what it makes it such a unique and powerful resource.

ü§ñ Note: AI Mock Interviews are available in Educative Premium & Premium Plus plans. Lock in your AI April discount or upgrade (https://learn.educative.io/e3t/Ctc/RG+113/cz5H404/VVGyzY938NPmW8xNHGd3C9_s9W3Dl4Sm5dwhJtN5n2LRv3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3mNW7Z1gj021-5zSW2RmlMB208fwZW4c7sZs6G8F7CVsQ-0l8k9gNKW2nzT1Q1vmPkwW399Gv387chq9W6LHvWq2L1swZVyLpcy5sltpnN8s-bjrG-0S4W6JQn2R1Gfr-LW8mq5Qw1qYpzqN6GDVxJ1NpKsW1Xdtwf5lg2gBN1-yhjkV9llDVbmSxj7ZcllhW41KTFb5z5CV3V9kkRc3S4PnGW5zcdx82MTDRdW6bw3qD7DBsqCVVfmHk2d0j7fW7mxkDG97F4RcW5tyb9G22ydw_W3RSvsV3kS5WtW1SfQTw12vNm4N2FGK0fyNbDzW2W90rL25FHNfW5Z4llH4Nv03xW7xd0yT6lbV5Rd1Yx1v04 ) before it expires.

üíº AI Mock Interviews

There‚Äôs an old piece of advice in developer circles: Interview at lots of different companies before you go interview with the company you really want to work with. While this may seem like a nice way to lower the stakes and get real world practice, it's highly inefficient and impractical.

Mock interviews, meanwhile, are a great way to get confidence and constructive feedback ‚Äî but unfortunately, 99% of candidates don‚Äôt have the resources to get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù mock interview before their interview. It can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars per interview to purchase one.

Plus, most people also don‚Äôt have friends who work at FAANG who will offer you their time to mock interview them!

Unlike traditional mock interviews, AI Mock Interviews give you multiple attempts to hone your skills ‚Äî without shelling out a ton of cash every time.

You can also prepare from the comfort of your home, without the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed or unprepared, or running the risk of burning any bridges.

The best part is that there are over 50 individual interview questions you can practice. For Coding Interviews, you can dive into dozens of the most popular data structures and coding interview patterns. For System Design, API Design, and OOD, you can get practice with dozens more real-world interview questions.

Above all, AI Mock Interviews are the perfect complement to our most popular interview prep courses here on Educative. In fact, with this addition, Educative is easily the most comprehensive tech interview prep platform in the industry.

If you have interviews coming up, I truly believe you don't need to look any further than Educative.

There are many new AI-powered learning experiences you can try on Educative today. But the one I‚Äôm most excited about right now is our AI Mock Interviewer.

It's the first of its kind in the industry. And now it's loaded up with even more interview loops (including Coding Interviews, System Design, API Design, and Object Oriented Design).

So today I want to tell you a bit about the inspiration for AI Mock Interviews ‚Äî and in my opinion what it makes it such a unique and powerful resource.

ü§ñ Note: AI Mock Interviews are available in Educative Premium & Premium Plus plans. Lock in your AI April discount or upgrade (https://learn.educative.io/e3t/Ctc/RG+113/cz5H404/VVGyzY938NPmW8xNHGd3C9_s9W3Dl4Sm5dwhJtN5n2LRv3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3mNW7Z1gj021-5zSW2RmlMB208fwZW4c7sZs6G8F7CVsQ-0l8k9gNKW2nzT1Q1vmPkwW399Gv387chq9W6LHvWq2L1swZVyLpcy5sltpnN8s-bjrG-0S4W6JQn2R1Gfr-LW8mq5Qw1qYpzqN6GDVxJ1NpKsW1Xdtwf5lg2gBN1-yhjkV9llDVbmSxj7ZcllhW41KTFb5z5CV3V9kkRc3S4PnGW5zcdx82MTDRdW6bw3qD7DBsqCVVfmHk2d0j7fW7mxkDG97F4RcW5tyb9G22ydw_W3RSvsV3kS5WtW1SfQTw12vNm4N2FGK0fyNbDzW2W90rL25FHNfW5Z4llH4Nv03xW7xd0yT6lbV5Rd1Yx1v04 ) before it expires.

üíº AI Mock Interviews

There‚Äôs an old piece of advice in developer circles: Interview at lots of different companies before you go interview with the company you really want to work with. While this may seem like a nice way to lower the stakes and get real world practice, it's highly inefficient and impractical.

Mock interviews, meanwhile, are a great way to get confidence and constructive feedback ‚Äî but unfortunately, 99% of candidates don‚Äôt have the resources to get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù mock interview before their interview. It can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars per interview to purchase one.

Plus, most people also don‚Äôt have friends who work at FAANG who will offer you their time to mock interview them!

Unlike traditional mock interviews, AI Mock Interviews give you multiple attempts to hone your skills ‚Äî without shelling out a ton of cash every time.

You can also prepare from the comfort of your home, without the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed or unprepared, or running the risk of burning any bridges.

The best part is that there are over 50 individual interview questions you can practice. For Coding Interviews, you can dive into dozens of the most popular data structures and coding interview patterns. For System Design, API Design, and OOD, you can get practice with dozens more real-world interview questions.

Above all, AI Mock Interviews are the perfect complement to our most popular interview prep courses here on Educative. In fact, with this addition, Educative is easily the most comprehensive tech interview prep platform in the industry.

If you have interviews coming up, I truly believe you don't need to look any further than Educative.
